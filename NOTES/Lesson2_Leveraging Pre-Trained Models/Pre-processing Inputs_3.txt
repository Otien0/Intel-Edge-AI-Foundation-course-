The pre-processing needed for a network will vary, but usually this is something you can check out in any related documentation, including in the OpenVINO™ Toolkit documentation. It can even matter what library you use to load an image or frame - OpenCV, which we’ll use to read and handle images in this course, reads them in the BGR format, which may not match the RGB images some networks may have used to train with.

Outside of channel order, you also need to consider image size, and the order of the image data, such as whether the color channels come first or last in the dimensions. Certain models may require a certain normalization of the images for input, such as pixel values between 0 and 1, although some networks also do this as their first layer.

In OpenCV, you can use cv2.imread to read in images in BGR format, and cv2.resize to resize them. The images will be similar to a numpy array, so you can also use array functions like .transpose and .reshape on them as well, which are useful for switching the array dimension order.S
