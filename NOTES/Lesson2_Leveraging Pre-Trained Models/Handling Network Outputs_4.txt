6.  Handling Network Outputs:
 A) Classification networks typically output an array with the softmax probabilities by class; the argmax of those probabilities can be matched up to an array by class for the prediction.

 B) Bounding boxes typically come out with multiple bounding box detections per image, which each box first having a class and confidence. Low confidence detections can be ignored. From there, there are also an additional four values, two of which are an X, Y pair, while the other may be the opposite corner pair of the bounding box, or otherwise a height and width.
 
 C) Semantic labels give the class for each pixel. Sometimes, these are flattened in the output, or a different size than the original image, and need to be reshaped or resized to map directly back to the input.
