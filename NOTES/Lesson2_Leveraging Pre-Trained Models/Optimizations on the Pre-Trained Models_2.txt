A. In the prvious exercise 1, we dealt with different precisions of the different models. Precisions are related to floating point values - less precision means less memory used by the model, and less compute resources. However, there are some trade-offs with accuracy when using lower precision. There is also fusion, where multiple layers can be fused into a single operation. These are achieved through the Model Optimizer in OpenVINOâ„¢, although the Pre-Trained Models have already been run through that process.

B. Choosing the Right Model for Your App:
Make sure to test out different models for your application, comparing and contrasting their use cases and performance for your desired task. Remember that a little bit of extra processing may yield even better results, but needs to be implemented efficiently.

This goes both ways - you should try out different models for a single use case, but you should also consider how a given model can be applied to multiple use cases. For example, being able to track human poses could help in physical therapy applications to assess and track progress of limb movement range over the course of treatment.
